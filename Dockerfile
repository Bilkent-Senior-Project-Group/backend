# Step 1: Use the .NET 8 SDK image to build the application
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS build

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the project file and restore dependencies
COPY CompanyHubService/CompanyHubService/CompanyHubService.csproj CompanyHubService/CompanyHubService/

RUN dotnet publish CompanyHubService/CompanyHubService/CompanyHubService.csproj -c Release -o /app/publish

# Step 2: Create the runtime image using the .NET 8 runtime
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0 AS base

# Set the working directory to /app for runtime
WORKDIR /app

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Set the environment variable to bind the app to all network interfaces on port 80
ENV ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://0.0.0.0:80

# Copy the published app from the build stage
COPY --from=build /app/publish .
